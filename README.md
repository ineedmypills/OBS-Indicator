> [!WARNING]  
> The functionality to display over **exclusive full-screen** applications is not implemented **and will not be implemented**. It requires deep knowledge in DirectX hooking, as well as certifcation (so that anti-cheat systems do not perceive indicators as cheats).
> 
> Indicators can be added to OBS **officially**  if you [**vote here**](https://ideas.obsproject.com/posts/2454/obs-visual-rec-pause-stop-indicator).
> 
> Use **windowed full-screen mode**.
