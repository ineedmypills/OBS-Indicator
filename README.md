## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup

Just follow these 3 steps to get up and running.

### Step 1: Download the Script

1.  Go to the [**Releases Page**](https://github.com/ineedmypills/OBS-Indicator/releases).
2.  Download the latest version of the `OBSIndicator.py` file.

### Step 2: Install the Dependency (PyQt5)

The script uses the `PyQt5` library to display the icons.

1. Open OBS Studio.
2. Go to **Tools ‚Üí Scripts**.
3. Click the **Python Settings** tab and make sure your Python Install Path is set. If it's empty, you may need to install Python from [this repo for example](https://github.com/zooba/obs-python) and point OBS to it.
4. Open **Command Prompt (CMD)** or **PowerShell as an Administrator**.
5. Navigate to your OBS Python folder
6. Install PyQt5 using pip:
    ```bash
    {path to python.exe} -m pip install PyQt5
    ```

### Step 3: Add the Script to OBS

1.  Go back to the **Tools ‚Üí Scripts** window in OBS.
2.  In the **Scripts** tab, click the `+` (Add Script) icon in the bottom left.
3.  Select the `OBSIndicator.py` file you downloaded earlier.

That's it! The script is now installed and ready to go.

## üöÄ Usage

Once installed, the script works automatically:

-   An **icon appears** when you start recording or save a replay buffer.
-   The **icon disappears** when you stop recording.

## üé® Customization

You can customize the indicator's appearance directly within OBS.

1.  Go to **Tools ‚Üí Scripts**.
2.  Select `OBS Indicator` from the list of loaded scripts.
3.  A panel with customization options will appear on the right:
    -   **Screen Position**: Choose which corner of the screen to display the icon in.
    -   **Padding**: Fine-tune the icon's exact position with pixel offsets.
    -   **Opacity**: Make the icon more or less transparent.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> If the indicator disappears after you change its settings, you'll need to restart OBS Studio for the changes to take effect.
